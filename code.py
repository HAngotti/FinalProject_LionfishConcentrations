Projected Lionfish Population Dynamics in the Mediterranean as it Relates 
to Sea Surface Temperature Data 

BACKGROUND: 
    
    Lionfish are known as the ideal invaders due to their lack of natural 
    predators outside of their home range, their generalist diets, their 
    tolerance to a wide range of depths, temperatures, and salinity ranges, and 
    high reproductive rates. This species has already caused ecological 
    decimation to the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean since the 1980s but now 
    in more recent years, they have been sighted in the Mediterranean and with 
    increasing sea surface temperatures, better suited to their preference, 
    are projected to grow more rapidly. 


PURPOSE: 
    
    This model is simulating the spread and population dynamics of lionfish 
    species invasive to a specific geographic area (the Mediterranean) using a 
    a two-dimensional diffusion equation to model their spatial distribution 
    and population dynamics over time. It uses Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
    data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to 
    adjust the population growth rate of the lionfish based on the environmental
    conditions. The model also incorporates a logistic growth model to account 
    for the carrying capacity of the species.


MASTERKEY:
    
    Section 1: 
        file_path -- path to the NetCDF file containing Sea Surface Temperature 
        (SST) data.

        NetCDF file on Reconstructed SST records

        sea surface temperatures for each spatial grid

        each update of populations)
        carrying_cap -- the carrying capacity of the lionfish population

        specific geographic location in the Mediterranean (adjusted latitude 
        point = 28, adjusted longitude point = 110)

        density at each grid point
        c_lionfish -- the flattened 1D version of C_lionfish which can be used for 
        necessary computations

        stability condition
        sy -- the stability constant in the y-direction for the von Neumann 
        stability condition 
        
    Section 4:

        diffusion coefficients for the model at each individual grid point 
        ik -- the index for the 2D array 
        i -- common loop variable representing x-direction 
        k -- common loop variable representing y-direction
